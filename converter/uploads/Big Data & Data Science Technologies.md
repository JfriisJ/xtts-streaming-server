---

### **Apache Kafka**

**What is Apache Kafka?**
Apache Kafka is a distributed event-streaming platform designed to handle large volumes of real-time data efficiently. It acts as a message broker that allows data to move between systems or components.

---

### **Core Components of Kafka**

1. **Topics**:
    - Kafka organizes data into topics.
    - A **topic** is a category where data is published (e.g., "electricity_usage").
    - Think of a topic as a folder for related messages.
    
    Example:
    
    - Topic: `electric_cars_data`
    - Message: `{ "date": "2025-01-01", "electric_cars": 50000 }`
2. **Producers**:
    - Applications or systems that send (or publish) data to Kafka topics.
    - Example: A Python script fetching electricity data from an API sends it to the topic `energy_usage`.
3. **Consumers**:
    - Applications that read (or subscribe to) data from Kafka topics.
    - Example: A Spark job reading messages from the `energy_usage` topic for further analysis.
4. **Brokers**:
    - Kafka clusters consist of multiple brokers.
    - A broker is a server that stores and handles messages.
    - Example: Broker 1 stores messages for `electricity_usage`, Broker 2 handles `tariff_data`.
5. **Partitions**:
    - Each topic is divided into smaller parts called partitions.
    - Partitions allow Kafka to handle high-throughput data and distribute load across multiple brokers.
    
    Example:
    
    - Topic `electricity_usage` has 3 partitions:
        - Partition 0: Messages from 01:00-03:00.
        - Partition 1: Messages from 03:00-05:00.
        - Partition 2: Messages from 05:00-07:00.
6. **ZooKeeper**:
    - Kafka uses ZooKeeper to manage cluster metadata and configuration (though it is being replaced by Kafka Raft).

---

### **Kafka Features**

1. **Scalability**:
    - Kafka can handle growing data volumes by adding brokers or partitions.
    - Example: If electricity data volume increases, you can add partitions to the topic `energy_usage`.
2. **Durability**:
    - Messages are stored on disk, ensuring data isn't lost if a server fails.
3. **Real-time and Replay**:
    - Kafka supports both real-time streaming and replaying historical data.
    - Example: A consumer can replay messages from last week to reanalyze past trends.
4. **Decoupling Systems**:
    - Kafka acts as a middle layer, decoupling producers and consumers.
    - Example: The electricity API (producer) doesn’t need to directly send data to Spark (consumer). Kafka manages this.

---

### **How Kafka Works in Your Project**

- **Ingestion**: Data from sources like Energinet is sent to Kafka topics.
- **Processing**: Spark Streaming reads real-time data from Kafka.
- **Storage**: Kafka stores short-term data before sinking it into HDFS for long-term storage.

---

**Mini Example: Kafka in Action**

1. A Python producer fetches electricity prices hourly and sends:
    
    ```json
    { "time": "2025-01-11T10:00", "price": 0.15 }
    
    ```
    
    to the topic `electricity_prices`.
    
2. A Spark job consumes these messages, calculates daily averages, and stores:
    
    ```json
    { "date": "2025-01-11", "average_price": 0.13 }
    
    ```
    
    in HDFS.
    

---

### **Ingestion in Your Project**

### **What is Ingestion?**

In the context of your project, **ingestion** refers to the process of collecting raw data from external sources (e.g., Energinet APIs or Statistikbanken) and preparing it for further processing. It involves:

1. Fetching data from sources (APIs or files).
2. Transforming it to a usable format.
3. Sending it to the next stage (e.g., Kafka for transport).

---

### **How Ingestion is Done in Your Project**

1. **Custom-built Python Application**:
    - A Python-based application is used for ingestion.
    - It:
        - Fetches data from APIs (e.g., Energinet REST API).
        - Validates the data.
        - Checks for duplicates to avoid redundant entries.
        - Formats the data into a schema (e.g., Avro).
        - Publishes data to Kafka topics.
2. **Steps in the Flow**:
    - **Step 1: Fetch Data**:
        - Uses REST API endpoints to pull JSON data.
        - Example:
            - Energinet API endpoint: `https://api.energinet.dk/production-consumption`
            - Data fetched:
                
                ```json
                { "time": "2025-01-01T10:00", "production": 1000, "consumption": 950 }
                
                ```
                
    - **Step 2: Validate Data**:
        - Ensures data adheres to expected schemas.
        - Example: Validates that `time`, `production`, and `consumption` fields are present.
    - **Step 3: Deduplicate**:
        - Avoids duplicate ingestion using a caching layer (Redis).
        - Example: Checks if a message with the same `time` and `production` already exists in Redis.
    - **Step 4: Transform Data**:
        - Converts JSON into Avro format for efficiency.
        - Example Avro schema:
            
            ```
            {
              "type": "record",
              "name": "EnergyData",
              "fields": [
                { "name": "time", "type": "string" },
                { "name": "production", "type": "int" },
                { "name": "consumption", "type": "int" }
              ]
            }
            
            ```
            
    - **Step 5: Publish to Kafka**:
        - Publishes the formatted data to a Kafka topic (`electricity_data`).

---

### **Why a Custom-Built Application Over Tools Like Flume or NiFi?**

### **Advantages of Custom-Built Applications**

1. **Flexibility**:
    - Your ingestion needs are specific (e.g., working with APIs like Energinet and Statistikbanken).
    - Pre-built tools like Flume or NiFi may have generic capabilities but lack fine-grained control over:
        - API calls (rate-limiting, retries).
        - Complex data validation and deduplication logic.
    
    Example:
    
    - The custom app uses Redis to deduplicate Energinet data, ensuring no redundant records are sent to Kafka. This might not be easily configurable in Flume.
2. **Lightweight and Efficient**:
    - Flume and NiFi are heavy frameworks requiring significant setup.
    - For modest data ingestion volumes (e.g., hourly or minute-level data), a Python script with REST API handling is sufficient.
3. **Easier Debugging and Customization**:
    - Debugging errors in a custom script is straightforward compared to troubleshooting a Flume agent or NiFi flow.
    - Example:
        - If Energinet's API changes its schema, updating a Python script is simpler than reconfiguring a NiFi pipeline.
4. **Lower Resource Overhead**:
    - Running Flume or NiFi in a Kubernetes cluster would require more CPU and memory resources compared to a lightweight Python container.
5. **Tighter Integration with Project Tools**:
    - Your custom app is tailored to integrate seamlessly with Kafka, Redis, and the Kubernetes environment.

---

### **Disadvantages of Pre-Built Tools Like Flume/NiFi**

1. **Complex Setup**:
    - Flume requires an intermediary channel (e.g., file channel) between ingestion and Kafka, adding unnecessary complexity.
    - Example: Your system already uses Kafka for message transport, making Flume redundant.
2. **Less Control**:
    - NiFi excels at drag-and-drop pipeline creation but can lack the deep programmatic control offered by a custom-built solution.
3. **Overkill for Your Use Case**:
    - Flume and NiFi are designed for very high-throughput ingestion and managing a variety of sources. Your system's primary ingestion needs are API-based and modest in scale, which do not justify the complexity of these tools.

---

### **When to Use Tools Like Flume or NiFi?**

- **Large-scale, multi-source ingestion**:
    - Example: Pulling data from hundreds of log files and databases in real-time.
- **Out-of-the-box solutions for non-developers**:
    - NiFi is ideal if the team lacks programming expertise and prefers a GUI-based solution.
- **Highly dynamic configurations**:
    - Example: Frequently adding or changing data sources and sinks.

---

### **Apache Spark**

Apache Spark is one of the most critical technologies for big data processing in your project. It enables both **real-time streaming** and **batch processing** for analyzing data efficiently.

---

### **What is Apache Spark?**

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for processing large datasets quickly. It provides APIs for multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, Scala) and can run on clusters of computers, making it highly scalable.

---

### **Core Components of Spark**

1. **Driver Program**:
    - The main application that submits tasks to the cluster.
    - Example: A Python script that runs a Spark job to compute average electricity usage per hour.
2. **Cluster Manager**:
    - Manages resources and assigns tasks to worker nodes.
    - Example in your project: Kubernetes acts as the cluster manager.
3. **Executor**:
    - Worker nodes that execute tasks assigned by the driver program.
    - Example: A worker node processes electricity data for a specific region.
4. **Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)**:
    - The core data structure in Spark, optimized for fault-tolerant, parallel processing.
    - Example: A dataset containing energy consumption records split across multiple nodes for parallel processing.

---

### **Key Features of Spark**

1. **In-Memory Processing**:
    - Unlike Hadoop, Spark keeps intermediate data in memory, making it faster for iterative computations.
    - Example: Calculating hourly averages of electricity consumption without reloading data from disk.
2. **Fault Tolerance**:
    - If a node fails, Spark rebuilds lost data from the RDD lineage.
    - Example: If a worker node analyzing tariffs crashes, Spark automatically reruns the task on another node.
3. **Scalability**:
    - Spark distributes tasks across a cluster, handling terabytes of data efficiently.
4. **Support for Multiple Workloads**:
    - Batch processing (e.g., analyzing historical electricity data).
    - Real-time streaming (e.g., processing data as it flows from Kafka).
    - Machine learning and graph processing.

---

### **How Spark is Used in Your Project**

    - Spark reads historical data from HDFS and processes it using Spark SQL or RDDs.
    - Example Job:
        - Input: Historical electricity consumption data.
        - Operation: Compute daily average electricity consumption for each municipality.
        - Output: Save results to HDFS in Parquet format.
2. **Real-Time Processing**:
    - Spark Streaming processes live data from Kafka topics.
    - Example Job:
        - Input: Data from the `electricity_usage` Kafka topic.
        - Operation: Compute rolling averages for electricity consumption in the last 24 hours.
        - Output: Send results to Redis for API queries.
3. **Integration with Other Tools**:
    - **Spark SQL**:
        - Queries data in HDFS or Hive using SQL-like syntax.
        - Example:
            
            ```sql
            SELECT AVG(consumption) FROM energy_data WHERE region = 'DK1';
            
            ```
            
    - **Spark with Kafka**:
        - Consumes real-time data from Kafka and processes it in micro-batches.
    - **Spark with Hive**:
        - Uses Hive’s metastore for structured querying.

---

### **Why Spark?**

1. **Efficiency**:
    - Spark’s in-memory processing is faster than alternatives like Hadoop MapReduce.
    - Example: Computing hourly electricity consumption using Spark takes seconds compared to minutes with MapReduce.
2. **Scalability**:
    - Your project needs to handle growing datasets (e.g., real-time electricity data). Spark scales horizontally by adding more nodes.
3. **Flexibility**:
    - Supports multiple types of workloads in a single platform (batch, real-time, and machine learning).
4. **Fault Tolerance**:
    - Ensures reliability in case of node failures, which is critical for long-running data jobs.

---

### **Example: Spark Streaming in Action**

Scenario: You want to calculate the total electricity consumed in the last hour.

1. **Input**:
    - Kafka topic: `electricity_usage`.
    - Data: `{ "timestamp": "2025-01-11T10:00", "usage": 100 }`.
2. **Spark Streaming Job**:
    - Micro-batch interval: 1 minute.
    - Query: Aggregate usage for the past hour.
3. **Output**:
    - Result: `{ "timestamp": "2025-01-11T10:00", "total_usage_last_hour": 5900 }`.
    - Sent to: Redis for API access.

---

### **Apache Spark Integration with Other Tools**

Spark integrates with various tools to meet the demands of big data processing. In your project, Spark works with **Kafka**, **Hive**, **HDFS**, **API**, and **Spark History** to handle real-time streaming, batch processing, data storage, querying, and job monitoring.

---

### **1. Spark with Kafka**

### **How It Works**:

- Spark Streaming consumes data from Kafka topics, processes it in micro-batches, and outputs the results to a sink (e.g., HDFS or Redis).

### **Steps of Integration**:

1. **Connect to Kafka**:
    - Spark connects to Kafka using Kafka’s API.
    - Example:
        
        ```python
        from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
        from pyspark.sql.functions import from_json, col
        
        spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("KafkaExample").getOrCreate()
        df = spark.readStream \
                  .format("kafka") \
                  .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "kafka-server:9092") \
                  .option("subscribe", "electricity_usage") \
                  .load()
        
        ```
        
2. **Process Data**:

    - Example: Aggregate electricity usage data by hour.
        
        ```python
        json_schema = "timestamp STRING, usage DOUBLE"
        data = df.selectExpr("CAST(value AS STRING)") \
                 .select(from_json(col("value"), json_schema).alias("data")) \
                 .select("data.timestamp", "data.usage")
        aggregated = data.groupBy("hour").sum("usage")
        
        ```
        
3. **Output Results**:

HDFS and Redis serve distinct but complementary roles in your project. Together, they create a system that balances **scalability** (via HDFS) and **speed** (via Redis), ensuring efficient storage, processing, and retrieval of data.

---

### **1. Workflow Overview**

- **HDFS**:
    - Acts as the primary storage for raw and processed data.
    - Used for large datasets like historical electricity consumption, tariffs, and vehicle data.
    - Optimized for batch processing with tools like Apache Spark.
- **Redis**:
    - Serves as a high-speed cache and metadata store.
    - Optimized for real-time, frequent lookups and intermediate data storage.
    - Reduces the load on HDFS for commonly accessed data.

---

### **2. Roles and Responsibilities**

### **HDFS Responsibilities**:

1. **Long-Term Data Storage**:
    - Stores both raw and processed datasets.
    - Example:
        - Raw Data: Hourly electricity consumption logs from Energinet.
        - Processed Data: Daily average consumption trends.

        - Key: `electricity_usage:2025-01-11T10:00`
        - Value: `{ "hash": "abc123" }`
        - If the same data is fetched again, ingestion skips it.
3. **Temporary Data Storage**:
    - Holds intermediate results for short-term use, such as during Spark Streaming jobs.
    - Example: Rolling 24-hour average electricity usage is stored in Redis for quick updates.

---

### **3. Examples of Cooperation**

### **Example 1: Real-Time Query Support**

**Scenario**: A user queries the API for the electricity usage of the past 24 hours.

- **Redis Role**:
    1. The API first checks Redis for the cached results.
    2. If the data exists in Redis (cached from the last Spark job), it responds immediately.
- **HDFS Role**:
    1. If Redis does not have the required data (cache miss), the API triggers a Spark job.
    2. Spark reads historical data from HDFS, computes the result, and writes it to Redis for future queries.
    3. The API retrieves the result from Redis and serves it to the user.

---

### **Example 2: Real-Time and Batch Data Processing**

**Scenario**: An hourly Spark Streaming job computes electricity usage summaries.

- **Redis Role**:
    - Stores intermediate results (e.g., current rolling averages) for use in real-time dashboards.
    - Example:
        - Key: `rolling_avg_usage:2025-01-11T10:00`
        - Value: `{ "region": "DK1", "average": 1500 }`
- **HDFS Role**:
    - Stores the finalized results of the Spark Streaming job for historical analysis.
    - Example:
        - File: `hdfs://namenode/processed/usage_summary/2025-01-11.parquet`

---

### **Example 3: System Resilience**

**Scenario**: A Spark job fails while processing hourly electricity data.

- **Redis Role**:
    - Maintains a log of the last successfully processed message from Kafka.
    - Example:
        - Key: `kafka_offset:usage_topic`
        - Value: `3456` (indicating the last processed message).
- **HDFS Role**:
    - Stores completed intermediate results from Spark, so the job can resume from the last checkpoint without reprocessing everything.
    - Example:
        - Checkpoint Directory: `hdfs://namenode/checkpoints/spark_job_id`

---

### **4. Benefits of Cooperation**

### **Speed and Efficiency**:

- Redis handles frequently accessed or real-time data, reducing the need for costly HDFS lookups.
- HDFS stores large, infrequently accessed datasets, keeping the system cost-effective.

### **Optimized Workflows**:

- Redis serves as a bridge for real-time analytics while HDFS supports long-term storage and batch processing.
- Example: Real-time dashboards fetch Redis data, while monthly reports use HDFS data.

### **System Resilience**:

- Redis provides fallback and caching mechanisms to ensure API responsiveness even if HDFS or Spark jobs are delayed.
- HDFS ensures that no data is lost, providing a complete record for reprocessing if necessary.

---

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    from pyspark.sql.functions import avg, to_date, col
    
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("BatchJob").getOrCreate()
    
    # Read data from HDFS
    df = spark.read.parquet("hdfs://namenode/energy/usage/2025-01.parquet")
    
    # Calculate daily averages
    daily_avg = df.withColumn("date", to_date(col("timestamp"))) \
                  .groupBy("region", "date") \
                  .agg(avg("usage").alias("avg_usage"))
    
    ```
    
3. **Output**:
    - Writes aggregated results to HDFS for long-term storage.
    - Caches the most recent daily average in Redis for quick access by the API.
    
    Example Code for Writing to HDFS:
    
    ```python
    daily_avg.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("hdfs://namenode/processed/daily_avg/")
    
    ```
    
    Example Code for Storing in Redis:
    
    ```python
    import redis
    
    redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host="redis-server", port=6379, db=0)
    for row in daily_avg.collect():
        key = f"daily_avg:{row['region']}:{row['date']}"
        value = row['avg_usage']
        redis_client.set(key, value)
    
    ```
    

### **How Redis and HDFS Cooperate**:

- HDFS stores the complete daily averages for all regions and dates.
- Redis stores only the latest daily average, enabling the API to respond to real-time queries without querying HDFS.

---

### **2. Real-Time Processing: Sliding Window Aggregation**

**Scenario**: Continuously calculate a rolling 24-hour average electricity usage for each region using data streamed from Kafka. Store intermediate results in Redis and finalized results in HDFS.

### **Workflow**:

1. **Input**:
    - Data streamed from Kafka topic: `electricity_usage`.
        - Example Message: `{ "timestamp": "2025-01-11T10:00", "region": "DK1", "usage": 100 }`
2. **Processing in Spark Streaming**:
    - Read data from Kafka in micro-batches.
    - Perform a sliding window aggregation (24-hour rolling average).
    - Cache the latest rolling averages in Redis.
    - Save hourly aggregates to HDFS for historical analysis.
    
    Example Spark Code:
    
    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.functions import window
    
    # Read streaming data from Kafka
    kafka_df = spark.readStream \
        .format("kafka") \
        .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "kafka-server:9092") \
        .option("subscribe", "electricity_usage") \
        .load()
    
    # Extract fields from Kafka messages
    data = kafka_df.selectExpr("CAST(value AS STRING)") \
                   .select(from_json(col("value"), schema).alias("data")) \
                   .select("data.timestamp", "data.region", "data.usage")
    
    # Perform sliding window aggregation
    rolling_avg = data.withWatermark("timestamp", "1 hour") \
                      .groupBy(window("timestamp", "24 hours", "1 hour"), "region") \
                      .agg(avg("usage").alias("rolling_avg"))
    
    ```
    
3. **Output**:
    - Write rolling averages to Redis for API consumption.
    - Save hourly aggregates to HDFS.
    
    Example Code for Writing to Redis:
    
    ```python
    for row in rolling_avg.collect():
        key = f"rolling_avg:{row['region']}"
        value = row['rolling_avg']
        redis_client.set(key, value)
    
    ```
    
    Example Code for Writing to HDFS:
    
    ```python
    rolling_avg.writeStream \
        .format("parquet") \
        .option("path", "hdfs://namenode/processed/rolling_avg/") \
        .start()
    
    ```
    

### **How Redis and HDFS Cooperate**:

- Redis provides fast access to the latest rolling averages for dashboards and real-time analytics.
- HDFS stores the hourly aggregates, allowing for historical trend analysis.

---

### **3. Error Handling and Recovery**

**Scenario**: Ensure system resilience by leveraging Redis for checkpoints and HDFS for reprocessing in case of failure.

### **Workflow**:

1. **Checkpoints in Redis**:
    - Redis tracks the last successfully processed Kafka offset.
    - Example:
        - Key: `kafka_offset:electricity_usage`
        - Value: `3456`
    
    Code to Update Offset:
    
    ```python
    redis_client.set("kafka_offset:electricity_usage", offset)
    
    ```
    
2. **Reprocessing with HDFS**:
    - If a failure occurs, the Spark job fetches the offset from Redis and resumes processing from the checkpoint.
    - For corrupted or incomplete data, Spark reads raw data from HDFS to reprocess it.
    
    Example Code for Resuming from Offset:
    
    ```python
    last_offset = redis_client.get("kafka_offset:electricity_usage")
    df = spark.read \
             .format("kafka") \
             .option("startingOffsets", f"""{{"electricity_usage": {{ "0": {last_offset} }} }}""") \
             .load()
    
    ```
    

### **How Redis and HDFS Cooperate**:

- Redis ensures quick recovery by storing checkpoints for streaming jobs.
- HDFS acts as a fallback for complete reprocessing if the job needs to restart from scratch.

---

### **Benefits of Leveraging Redis and HDFS Together**

1. **Speed and Responsiveness**:
    - Redis ensures real-time data availability for APIs and dashboards.
    - HDFS handles large-scale data for deep analysis and historical trends.
2. **Resilience**:
    - Redis provides fast recovery points for streaming jobs.
    - HDFS ensures data durability and enables complete reprocessing if necessary.
3. **Optimized Costs**:
    - Redis reduces the need for frequent HDFS queries, lowering processing costs.
    - HDFS provides cost-effective storage for large datasets compared to in-memory solutions.

---

### **API Integration in Your Project**

APIs act as the bridge between your big data backend and the end users or systems accessing your data. In your project, APIs provide access to processed data, trigger Spark jobs, and facilitate communication with other components like Redis and HDFS.

---

### **1. Role of APIs in the Project**

APIs serve multiple purposes:

1. **Data Retrieval**:
    - APIs enable end-users to query processed data stored in Redis or HDFS.
    - Example: An API endpoint returns electricity usage data for a specific date range.
2. **Job Management**:
    - APIs trigger Spark jobs for data processing.
    - Example: An endpoint `/startJob` initiates a batch Spark job to compute electricity consumption trends.
3. **Real-Time Updates**:
    - APIs provide real-time data (e.g., rolling averages) by fetching cached results from Redis.
4. **Flexibility**:
    - APIs allow integration with external systems, making the data accessible for broader use cases like dashboards or reports.

---

### **2. Key API Endpoints**

### **a) Data Retrieval**

- **Endpoint**: `/getUsage`
- **Description**: Retrieves electricity usage data for a specified time range and region.
- **Parameters**:
    - `start_date`: Start date for data retrieval (e.g., `2025-01-01`).
    - `end_date`: End date for data retrieval (e.g., `2025-01-07`).
    - `region`: Region of interest (e.g., `DK1`, `DK2`).
- **Workflow**:
    1. API checks Redis for cached results.
    2. If not found, it queries processed data in HDFS using Spark SQL.
    3. Returns the result in the requested format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
    
    Example Response:
    
    ```json
    {
      "region": "DK1",
      "start_date": "2025-01-01",
      "end_date": "2025-01-07",
      "average_usage": 1500
    }
    
    ```
    

### **b) Job Trigger**

- **Endpoint**: `/startJob`
- **Description**: Triggers a Spark batch job to process raw data.
- **Parameters**:
    - `job_type`: Type of job (e.g., `daily_avg`, `monthly_trend`).
    - `date_range`: Date range for the job.
- **Workflow**:
    1. API sends a request to the middleware managing Spark jobs.
    2. Middleware starts the specified Spark job.
    3. API provides job status and results upon completion.
    
    Example Response:
    
    ```json
    {
      "job_id": "12345",
      "status": "running"
    }
    
    ```
    

### **c) Real-Time Updates**

- **Endpoint**: `/getRollingAvg`
- **Description**: Fetches the rolling 24-hour electricity usage average for a region.
- **Parameters**:
    - `region`: Region of interest.
- **Workflow**:
    1. API queries Redis for the rolling average.
    2. Returns the cached result directly.
    3. If not available, the API triggers a real-time Spark Streaming job.
    
    Example Response:
    
    ```json
    {
      "region": "DK1",
      "rolling_avg": 1600
    }
    
    ```
    

---

### **3. Tools and Frameworks for API Development**

1. **Flask (Python)**:
    - Lightweight and easy to integrate with Spark and Redis.
    - Ideal for projects with moderate API complexity.
2. **FastAPI (Python)**:
    - Faster than Flask and supports asynchronous operations.
    - Built-in support for OpenAPI documentation.
    - Example Code:
        
        ```python
        from fastapi import FastAPI
        
        app = FastAPI()
        
        @app.get("/getUsage")
        async def get_usage(region: str, start_date: str, end_date: str):
            # Query Redis or Spark here
            return {"region": region, "start_date": start_date, "end_date": end_date, "average_usage": 1500}
        
        ```
        
3. **Spring Boot (Java)**:
    - Robust framework for enterprise-grade APIs.
    - Suitable for projects requiring scalability and advanced features.
4. **Node.js**:
    - Fast, asynchronous APIs.
    - Great for real-time applications.

---

### **4. Integration with Redis and HDFS**

### **API with Redis**:

1. **Cached Data**:
    - Real-time queries directly access Redis.
    - Example: `/getRollingAvg` fetches cached rolling averages.
    - Code:
        
        ```python
        import redis
        
        redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host="redis-server", port=6379)
        
        @app.get("/getRollingAvg")
        async def get_rolling_avg(region: str):
            key = f"rolling_avg:{region}"
            rolling_avg = redis_client.get(key)
            return {"region": region, "rolling_avg": rolling_avg}
        
        ```
        
2. **Fallback Mechanism**:
    - If data is not in Redis, the API triggers Spark to recompute it.

### **API with HDFS**:

1. **Historical Data Retrieval**:
    - APIs query HDFS for large datasets using Spark SQL.
    - Example: `/getUsage` queries daily electricity usage data.
    - Code:
        
        ```python
        from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
        
        spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("APIExample").getOrCreate()
        
        @app.get("/getUsage")
        async def get_usage(region: str, start_date: str, end_date: str):
            query = f"""
                SELECT date, AVG(usage) as avg_usage
                FROM energy_data
                WHERE region = '{region}' AND date BETWEEN '{start_date}' AND '{end_date}'
                GROUP BY date
            """
            df = spark.sql(query)
            return df.toJSON().collect()
        
        ```
        
2. **Precomputed Results**:
    - Spark jobs periodically save summarized data in HDFS, which APIs access for faster responses.

---

### **5. Why This API Setup Works**

1. **Flexibility**:
    - Combines real-time and historical data access seamlessly.
    - Supports custom queries and job execution.
2. **Efficiency**:
    - Redis handles frequent, real-time queries, reducing the load on Spark and HDFS.
    - HDFS ensures scalability for large datasets.
3. **Ease of Integration**:
    - APIs connect with Spark jobs, Redis, and HDFS, enabling smooth workflows and user interaction.

### **Spark History: Job Monitoring and Debugging**

Spark History is a vital component of your big data ecosystem, providing detailed insights into the execution of Spark jobs. It enables you to monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and debug errors in your batch and streaming jobs.

---

### **1. What is Spark History?**

Spark History Server is a tool that tracks and visualizes the execution of Spark applications. It stores detailed logs about the execution of jobs, stages, and tasks, including:

1. **Job Status**: Whether the job succeeded, failed, or is still running.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Resource utilization (e.g., CPU, memory), execution times, and shuffle read/write operations.
3. **Task Details**: Information on task distribution across nodes and any failures.
4. **Execution DAGs**: Visual representation of the job's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

---

### **2. How Spark History Works**

### **Step 1: Enable Spark Event Logging**

- To use Spark History, enable event logging in your Spark configuration. This writes detailed job execution logs to a storage directory (e.g., HDFS).

Example Configuration (`spark-defaults.conf`):

```bash
spark.eventLog.enabled true
spark.eventLog.dir hdfs://namenode/spark-logs

```

### **Step 2: Start the Spark History Server**

- The server reads event logs from the specified directory and provides a web interface for monitoring.
- Command to start the History Server:
    
    ```bash
    start-history-server.sh --properties-file spark-defaults.conf
    
    ```
    

### **Step 3: Access the Web Interface**

- The web UI displays:
    - A list of completed Spark jobs.
    - Detailed views of each job, including tasks, stages, and resource utilization.

---

### **3. Features of Spark History Server**

1. **Job and Stage Metrics**:
    - Track execution times, data shuffle sizes, and task distribution.
    - Example: Identify which stage of a batch job took the longest time.
2. **Execution DAG**:
    - Visualize the flow of operations in a Spark job.
    - Example: A DAG might show transformations like `map`, `filter`, and `reduceByKey` as interconnected nodes.
3. **Task Distribution**:
    - Monitor how tasks are distributed across worker nodes.
    - Example: Ensure tasks are balanced and no node is overloaded.
4. **Error Tracking**:
    - Identify failed tasks and the reasons for failure.
    - Example: Detect memory allocation errors during a large shuffle operation.
5. **Resource Utilization**:
    - View CPU, memory, and disk usage for each task.
    - Example: Optimize executor settings for better performance.

---

### **4. Use of Spark History in Your Project**

### **Monitoring Batch Jobs**:

- Batch jobs, like calculating daily electricity averages, can be monitored to:
    1. Ensure they complete on time.
    2. Analyze how resources are used.
    3. Debug failed stages if a job crashes.

### **Debugging Streaming Jobs**:

- Spark Streaming jobs process real-time data from Kafka. Use Spark History to:
    1. Check micro-batch processing times.
    2. Identify delays or bottlenecks in data ingestion or aggregation.
    3. Ensure the job keeps up with real-time data flows.

### **Optimizing Job Performance**:

- Example: A job processing hourly electricity data takes longer than expected. Using Spark History, you find:
    - A particular stage (e.g., a shuffle operation) is the bottleneck.
    - The stage can be optimized by increasing the number of partitions.

---

### **5. Integration with Other Tools**

1. **Redis for Job Status**:
    - Spark History provides detailed job metrics, but Redis can store job statuses for quick API access.
    - Example: Store statuses like `running`, `completed`, or `failed` in Redis for an endpoint like `/jobStatus`.
2. **HDFS for Log Storage**:
    - Spark History reads event logs from HDFS, ensuring scalability for large jobs.
    - Example: Logs for long-running batch jobs are stored in `hdfs://namenode/spark-logs/`.
3. **APIs for User Access**:
    - Expose Spark History metrics through APIs.
    - Example: An endpoint `/jobMetrics` returns details like total execution time, shuffle sizes, and task counts.

---

### **6. Alternatives to Spark History**

### **a) Apache Airflow**:

- Use Airflow to orchestrate and monitor workflows, including Spark jobs.
- Pros:
    - Rich DAG-based visualization.
    - Handles dependencies between multiple jobs.

4. **Scalability**:
    - Handles logs from multiple jobs across large clusters, ensuring no data is lost.

---

### **Debugging and Optimizing a Spark Job with Spark History**

Let’s explore how Spark History Server can be used to **debug** a failing job and **optimize** a slow Spark job. Below are two practical scenarios, with a detailed walkthrough of how Spark History helps resolve these issues.

---

### **1. Debugging a Failing Spark Job**

### **Scenario**:

A Spark batch job that processes electricity usage data from HDFS is failing during execution. The job involves a large shuffle operation, and the failure is intermittent.

---

### **Steps to Debug with Spark History**

1. **Access Spark History Server**:
    - Navigate to the History Server UI.
    - Locate the failing job in the job list by its ID or name.
2. **Inspect the Job Details**:
    - Click on the job to view detailed metrics and logs.
    - Identify the stage or task that failed.
    
    Example:
    
    - The failure occurs during **Stage 2** (a shuffle operation).
    - The error message indicates "Out of Memory" errors on some executors.
3. **Analyze the Execution DAG**:
    - Review the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for the job to understand its flow.
    - Example:
        - **Stage 1**: Reads data from HDFS.
        - **Stage 2**: Performs a `groupBy` operation, triggering a shuffle.
4. **Check Task Distribution**:
    - View the number of tasks in each stage and their execution times.
    - Example:
        - Stage 2 has a very high task duration and skewed distribution (some tasks take significantly longer than others).
5. **Inspect Logs for Errors**:
    - Click on the failed tasks to view their logs.
    - Example:
        - Executors running tasks for Stage 2 ran out of memory, indicating the shuffle data is too large.

---

### **Debugging Insights**:

- The `groupBy` operation in Stage 2 caused a shuffle, where intermediate data exceeded the memory available to executors.
- Task skewing (uneven task sizes) exacerbated the issue.

---

### **Fixes**:

1. **Increase Executor Memory**:
    - Increase the `spark.executor.memory` configuration to handle larger shuffle data.
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    spark.executor.memory=4g
    
    ```
    
2. **Optimize the Shuffle**:
    - Reduce the shuffle size by increasing the number of partitions using `repartition` or `coalesce`.
    
    Example Code:
    
    ```python
    df = df.repartition(100, "region")
    
    ```
    
3. **Handle Skewed Data**:
    - Use techniques like salting to distribute data more evenly across tasks.
    
    Example Code:
    
    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.functions import col, concat, lit
    df = df.withColumn("salted_key", concat(col("region"), lit("_"), (rand() * 10).cast("int")))
    df = df.groupBy("salted_key").agg(...)
    
    ```
    

---

### **2. Optimizing a Slow Spark Job**

### **Scenario**:

A Spark job that computes daily electricity consumption averages is taking much longer than expected. The job involves reading data from HDFS, performing aggregations, and writing the results back to HDFS.

---

### **Steps to Optimize with Spark History**

1. **Access Job Metrics**:
    - Open the job in Spark History Server.
    - Check the **total execution time** and time taken by each stage.
    
    Example:
    
    - Stage 1 (data read): 30 seconds.
    - Stage 2 (aggregation): 3 minutes.
    - Stage 3 (write to HDFS): 20 seconds.
    
    Observation: Stage 2 is the bottleneck.
    
2. **Analyze Data Skew**:
    - View the task distribution for Stage 2.
    - Example:
        - Most tasks complete in 5-10 seconds, but a few take over a minute.
        - This indicates skewed data.
3. **Inspect Shuffle Metrics**:
    - Look at the shuffle read and write sizes for Stage 2.
    - Example:
        - Total shuffle size is 500 MB, with individual tasks processing up to 100 MB.
4. **Check Resource Utilization**:
    - Review CPU and memory usage for executors.
    - Example:
        - Executors are underutilized, indicating that increasing parallelism might help.

---

### **Optimization Insights**:

- Data skew in Stage 2 causes some tasks to take significantly longer, leading to delays.
- Shuffle operations are costly due to large intermediate data volumes.

---

### **Fixes**:

1. **Increase Parallelism**:
    - Increase the number of partitions to improve task distribution and reduce shuffle sizes.
    
    Example Configuration:
    
    ```bash
    spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=200
    
    ```
    
2. **Optimize Aggregations**:
    - Use `reduceByKey` instead of `groupByKey` to minimize shuffle data.
    
    Example Code:
    
    ```python
    rdd = df.rdd.map(lambda x: (x['region'], x['usage']))
    reduced = rdd.reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)
    
    ```
    
3. **Enable Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)**:
    - AQE dynamically adjusts the number of shuffle partitions based on runtime statistics.
    
    Example Configuration:
    
    ```bash
    spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=true
    
    ```
    

---

### **Revisiting Spark History After Fixes**

- After applying optimizations, rerun the job and revisit Spark History.
- Compare metrics like:
    - Total execution time.
    - Stage execution times.
    - Resource utilization.
    
    Example:
    
    - Before Optimization: Job took 5 minutes; Stage 2 took 3 minutes.
    - After Optimization: Job takes 2 minutes; Stage 2 takes 1 minute.

---

### **Key Benefits of Using Spark History for Debugging and Optimization**

1. **Detailed Insights**:
    - Provides granular metrics for every stage and task.
    - Enables identification of bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
2. **Visual DAGs**:
    - Easy-to-understand visualizations of the execution flow.
3. **Task-Level Analysis**:
    - Highlights issues like task skew, memory overloads, or slow shuffles.
4. **Iterative Improvements**:
    - Monitor the impact of configuration changes or code optimizations.

### **Lessons Learned and Future Improvements in Your Project**

In any big data project, reflecting on lessons learned and identifying areas for improvement are crucial for refining the system. Based on your project's architecture, implementation, and challenges, this topic focuses on the insights gained and the steps to make the system more robust, efficient, and scalable.

---

### **1. Key Lessons Learned**

### **a) Complexity of Ingestion**

- **Challenge**: Developing custom ingestion pipelines for APIs like Energinet and Statistikbanken was more difficult than anticipated.
    - **Example**: Energinet’s API lacked unique identifiers, requiring additional logic for deduplication.
    - **Solution**: Introduced Redis for deduplication and tracking API offsets.
- **Takeaway**: API design and documentation are critical for smooth integration. Pre-built tools like Apache NiFi may simplify ingestion for similar future projects.

---

### **b) Rapid Growth in Infrastructure Complexity**

- **Challenge**: Using tools like Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) added operational complexity, especially when team members lacked experience.
    - **Example**: Sharing the Terraform state file across team members became a bottleneck during deployment.
    - **Solution**: Adopted a single maintainer approach for Terraform, but this limited team collaboration.
- **Takeaway**: For projects with tight timelines, simpler deployment tools (e.g., Helm charts) might be better than IaC tools like Terraform.

---

### **c) Scaling Challenges**

- **Challenge**: Limited Kubernetes cluster resources (single-node) hindered scaling and testing under realistic conditions.
    - **Example**: High ingestion rates overwhelmed the system during tests.
    - **Solution**: Focused on optimizing resource allocation (e.g., reducing Kafka partition sizes, tuning Spark executor memory).
- **Takeaway**: Always design systems with scalability in mind, even if deployment starts on limited infrastructure.
