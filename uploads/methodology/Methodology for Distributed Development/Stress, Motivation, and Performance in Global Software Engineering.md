# Stress, Motivation, and Performance in Global Software Engineering

**Recap of "Stress, Motivation, and Performance in Global Software Engineering"**

### **Main Points**

This article presents a systematic mapping study that examines stress, motivation, and performance among developers in Global Software Development (GSD). It identifies factors that influence these dimensions and discusses possible solutions.

### **Main Contents**

1. **Background**:
- GSD involves challenges such as time zones, geographical distances, and cultural differences.
- Work-related stress and low motivation are widespread problems that can affect productivity.
2. **Method**:
- A systematic review of 118 academic publications was conducted to identify factors that influence stress, motivation, and performance in GSD.
- Articles were grouped based on their relevance to the company, projects, or human factors.
3. **Results**:
- **Stress factors**:
- Work pressure, cultural distance, poor communication and lack of trust.
- **Motivational factors**:
- Recognition, clear roles, good feedback and work-related balance.
- **Performance factors**:
- Effective knowledge transfer, clear requirements, teamwork and adapted management.
4. **Solutions**:
- **Reduce stress**:
- Reduce work pressure, improve communication and promote trust.
- **Increase motivation**:
- Recognition, challenging tasks, better work balance and greater autonomy.
- **Improve performance**:
- Structured knowledge management, agile method and investment in employee development.
5. **Common factors**:
- Seven factors affect stress, motivation and performance simultaneously:
- Communication, cultural distance, lack of trust, time zones, poor knowledge transfer, requirement changes and poor requirement specifications.

### **Conclusion**

- Companies can improve employee well-being and performance by focusing on social factors such as trust, communication, and recognition.
- Agile methods are recommended as an effective solution to reduce stress and increase motivation and performance.
- Further research is needed on the relationship between stress, motivation, and performance in GSD.

This article emphasizes the importance of addressing human and organizational factors to create successful distributed teams.


## Abstract

The objective of this study is to analyze the current perspective as regards knowl-
edge related to what causes stress or motivates developers, how these two aspects
are related to each other, and how this in turn affects their performance in the sphere
of Global Software Development and how these can be controlled This paper pre-
sents the results obtained after conducting a systematic mapping study of literature
in order to analyze how stress, motivation, and performance affect the project mem-
bers in Global Software Development teams. We carried out a systematic mapping of
published studies dealing with stress, motivation. and performance in global software
engineering. A total of 118 papers dealing with this subject were found. The litera-
ture analyzed provided a relatively significant quantity of data referring to the impact
that the characteristics of distributed software development projects have on the
performance and productivity of teams, along with the actions taken to improve that
performance. However, when focusing on the analysis of the impact of this type of
projects on team members• motivation. and on the actions that can be taken to
improve that motivation, we discovered that the number of works decreases consid-
erably and that works referring to the impact of this kind of development on devel-
opers' stress were virtually non-existent, as were those conceming ways in which to
improve that stress. We are, therefore, of the opinion that it is necessary to carry out
in-depth research into the aspects of working in distributed teams that may have a
negative impact on developers' levels of motivation and stress, along with what could
be beneficial in order to improve levels of motivation and decrease levels of stress.

## CONCLUSIONS

In this review, we have identified 22 factors that affect the stress levels of developers wotking on distributed projects. Forty-three factors that
affect rnotivation and 55 that affect performance have been also found. Moreover. the factors have been classified according to whether they
depend on the company, the project, or human features- This classification helps to reflect on the nature Of each factor. With regard to the
aspects that reduce the kvel of stress, eight factors were related to the company. one was related to the project, and five were related to hurnan
features. upon analyzing the factors that increase motivation, it was discovered that 28 factors concern the company, 7 are related to the project,
and 2 are related to features. In the Case Of increasing prodLRtivity and performance, 46 factors Were related to the company, B concerned
the project, and 11 were related to human features. These results are very interesting for software factories, since the largest group of factors is
that which depends on the company's policy. Cornpanies could, therefore. study which factors to irnprove or enhance in order to create an opti-
mum work environment With which to improve and performance and reduce stress. This Will have an indirect influence On Other
aspects such as turnover will consequently reduce the probability of employees changing company and taking the intellectual capital formed
by the company with them.
Another contribution is the analyses Of the Of the factors that jointly affect developers' levels Of stress. motivation, and performance.
which are ternporal distance, cultural distance, lack of trust, bad quality of requirements, cornmunication problems, knowledge management prob-
lems. and ch&lges to We are of the opinion that, without ignoring the other aspects, it is necessary to focus mainly on controlling
these factors.
Another interesting finding is that, according to literature, the usage of agile methodologies irnproves perforrnance and rnotivation and reduces
stress, and it would, therefore, also be convenient for those companies that have not yet done so to contemplate the use of agile methodologies.
Furthermore, this review verifies that, although significant number Of works tackle the problems related to performance in GSD projects and
how to deal with them, there are relatively few papers concerning the impact of these projects on motivation and very few concerning the impact
of GSD projects on their team members' stress. We, therefore, consider that more studies on this area are necessary.
In it is possible to State that the contributions Of this paper are also useful for project heads for three Since it may allow
them to dscover which factors have an influence on stress, motivation, and performance ard help them to decide which employees might be best
for a specific project or even what profile a person who is going to be hired should have. They might also be able to predict the vyoblems could
arise in a project owing to the projects' domain and the ernpk)yees• features. thus allowing risks to be in advance_
Furthermore, it is important to consider that team members could also take the soft skills mentioned in this paper into consideration and
atternpt to evaluate the extent to which they can be improved with the objective of increasing their performance, reducing their stress and
irnprOving their motivaticn
This paper could also be interesting for universities, Since it would allow them to discover which soft Skills could added to their curricula in
order to improve student'S' professional identities, as this is currently a hot topic, as stated in Kapoor and Garhr-McCune87 and Tornlinson and
Jackson. 8B
This Study is the first Step towards the creation Of a model that Will help cotnpanies to detect pro"ems in their projects and that Will propose
solutions to thetn. This model Will be developed as future work, along With a tool that Will help to automate that management.
