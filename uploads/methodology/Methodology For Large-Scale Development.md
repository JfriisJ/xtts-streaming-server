# **Methodology For Large-Scale Development**

### **Differences, Similarities, and Unique Features of Scrum and Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)**

---

### **1. What is Scrum?**

- **Definition**: Scrum is an agile methodology designed for small, self-directed teams that work in short iteration cycles (sprints) to deliver functional product increments.
- **Key Elements**:
- One **Product Owner** (PO), one **Scrum Master** (SM), and a **team** of 3-9 members.
- A **product backlog** prioritized by the PO.
- Ceremonies such as **sprint planning**, **daily standups**, **sprint reviews**, and **sprint retrospectives**.
- **Application**: Typically for small to medium-sized projects with a single development team.

---

### **2. What is Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)?**

- **Definition**: LeSS is a scaling framework designed to extend Scrum to large organizations with multiple teams working on the same product.
- **Key Elements**:
- Builds on the same principles as Scrum (transparency, inspection, and adaptation).
- Adds rules and guidelines for coordinating multiple Scrum teams.
- Introduces two variants:
- **LeSS**: For 2-8 teams.
- **LeSS Huge**: For more than 8 teams.

---

### **3. Commonalities between Scrum and LeSS**

- **Principles**:
- Focus on self-managing teams and short-term iteration goals.
- Transparency through shared ceremonies and regular feedback.
- Empirical process control (continuous inspection and adaptation of product and process).
- **Core Elements**:
- Both have a single **Product Owner** who manages a single **Product Backlog**.
- Teams deliver a common, **shippable product increment** at the end of a sprint.
- Both use ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily standups, reviews, and retrospectives.

### **4. How does LeSS differ from Scrum?**

### **4.1 Scaling Focus**

- **Scrum**:
- Designed for one team focusing on one specific area.
- **LeSS**:
- Designed to coordinate multiple teams working on one product.
- Introduces mechanisms such as **cross-team coordination** and **joint ceremonies**.

### **4.2 Organizational Focus**

- **Scrum**:
- Focuses on the team level and optimizes local processes.
- **LeSS**:
- Focuses on the entire system and optimizes the organization as a whole.
- Uses **systems thinking** to ensure that optimizing individual teams does not harm the overall product.

### **4.3 Roles**

- **Scrum**:
- One **Scrum Master** per team, focused on helping the team.
- **LeSS**:
- One Scrum Master can help multiple teams.
- Introduces roles like **Area Product Owner (APO)** in LeSS Huge to handle multiple backlog areas.

### **4.4 Ceremonies**

- **Scrum**:
- All ceremonies are team-specific.
- **LeSS**:
- **Joint Sprint Planning 1**: Coordinates which backlog items each team is working on.
- **Joint Sprint Review**: The entire organization reviews and provides feedback on the product.
- **Team-specific Sprint Planning 2**: Teams plan their own tasks to achieve common goals.

### **4.5 Backlog Structure**

- **Scrum**:
- One product backlog, managed by the Product Owner.
- **LeSS**:
- One central product backlog, but in LeSS Huge **Area Product Backlogs** are introduced to divide the work between multiple teams.

### **4.6 Coordination**

- **Scrum**:
- No specific framework for coordinating multiple teams.
- **LeSS**:
- Introduces methods like **Scrum of Scrums** and **Just Talk**, where teams coordinate directly.

---

### **5. What makes LeSS unique?**

- **Focus on Simplicity**:
- LeSS avoids adding more roles, processes, and artifacts, which sets it apart from other scaling frameworks like SAFe.
- **Systems Thinking**:
- Optimizing the whole over the parts.
- **Experimentation**:
- Encourages teams to experiment and adapt the process continuously.
- **Focus on the Whole Product**:
- All teams work on one unified product, with one shared sprint and one shippable product increment.

---

### **Conclusion**

LeSS builds on Scrum and retains its core principles, but adds scaling mechanisms to support large organizations. The difference lies in LeSS' focus on systems thinking, simplicity, and a shared product backlog to ensure coordination and high quality in large, complex projects. LeSS is ideal for organizations that want to maintain the flexibility of Scrum while scaling to multiple teams and larger projects.

**Recap of "Methodology For Large-Scale Development"**

### **Key Points**

This presentation explores methodologies and approaches for large software development projects with a focus on Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS). It analyzes challenges, principles, and frameworks to ensure success in complex projects.

### **Main Content**

1. **Background of Large Software Projects**:
- Modern software supports vital market segments such as e-banking and education.
- Large projects require complex systems, often with globally distributed teams.
- A study found that 98% of software developers must coordinate closely with other teams.
2. **Challenges in Large Projects**:
- **At the enterprise level**:
- Changes in policies can affect project costs and implementation.
- **At the process level**:
- Difficulty in managing requirements specification, validation, and maintenance.
- **At the team level**:
- Coordination, knowledge sharing, and managing employee turnover are critical.
3. **Methods for Large Projects**:
- Hybrid models like Waterfall-Scrum.
- Scaling frameworks like SAFe and LeSS.
4. **Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)**:
- LeSS was introduced in 2008 by Craig Larman and Bas Vodde.
- Maintains the core principles of Scrum, but adds scaling rules and guidelines.
- Focus areas:
- **Rules**: Structure and roles in teams.
- **Principles**: Transparency, systems thinking and empirical process control.
- **Guides and experiments**: Adaptation to the needs of the organization.
5. **LeSS Framework**:
- Two levels: LeSS (2-8 teams) and LeSS Huge (8+ teams).
- Common to both frameworks:
- A product backlog, one Product Owner and a shared sprint.
- Focus on systems thinking and the entire product rather than local optimizations.
6. **LeSS Sprint Planning**:
- **Sprint Planning 1**: Common for all teams with the participation of the Product Owner.
- **Sprint Planning 2**: Individual planning for each team.
- Sprint Review and Retrospective are common for all teams.
7. **Case Study: LeSS Adoption in Germany**:
- Four projects at an automobile manufacturer were analyzed.
- Challenges:
- Many meetings, dual leadership roles and resistance to change.
- Success factors:
- Extensive training, communication of vision and practical exercises.

### **Conclusion**

LeSS offers an effective framework for scaling Scrum in large organizations. Success depends on clear roles, communication, training and support from management. Challenges such as meeting load and organizational resistance can be solved through transparency and continuous improvement. The presentation emphasizes the importance of systems thinking and a holistic approach to achieving success in large projects.
