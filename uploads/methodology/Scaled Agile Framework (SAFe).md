# Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

### **Differences, Similarities, and Unique Features of Agile and Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)**

---

### **1. What is Agile?**

- **Definition**: Agile is a philosophy and approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of value through short iteration cycles.
- **The Agile Software Development Manifesto**:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Response to change over following a plan.
- **Typical Agile frameworks**:
- Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and Lean.

### **2. What is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)?**

- **Definition**: SAFe is a scaling framework designed to apply agile principles to large organizations with many teams, complex products, and multiple levels of management.
- **Purpose**: To balance the flexibility of agile principles with the structure and governance required in large organizations.
- **Four levels of SAFe**:
- **Team level**: Agile teams work like Scrum or Kanban teams.
- **Program level**: Coordinates multiple teams through Agile Release Trains (ARTs).
- **Large Solution level**: Handles complex solutions that require coordination of multiple ARTs.
- **Portfolio level**: Aligns strategic initiatives and budgets with organizational goals.

### **3. Common Traits Between Agile and SAFe**

- **Focus on Agility**:
- Both promote flexibility, rapid delivery, and continuous feedback.
- **Iterative and incremental approach**:
- Projects are broken down into smaller iterations that deliver value quickly and efficiently.
- **Customer focus**:
- Both Agile and SAFe prioritize meeting customer needs through close collaboration.
- **Self-organization**:
- Teams are autonomous and have the freedom to decide how to solve tasks.

### **4. Differences between Agile and SAFe**

### **4.1 Scope**

- **Agile**:
- Designed for small teams (3-9 people) working on a single project.
- Focus on team level and optimization of local processes.
- **SAFe**:
- Designed for organizations with hundreds or thousands of employees.
- Focus on systemic optimization across teams, programs and portfolios.

### **4.2 Structure**

- **Agile**:
- Flexible structure without fixed hierarchy.
- No defined processes for inter-team coordination.
- **SAFe**:
- Fixed structure with defined roles (e.g. Release Train Engineer, Solution Architect).
- Hierarchical division of team, program, solution and portfolio levels.

### **4.3 Governance**

- **Agile**:
- Minimal governance, giving teams autonomy.
- **SAFe**:
- More governance to ensure alignment between teams and the organization's strategic goals.

### **4.4 Scaling**

- **Agile**:
- No built-in scaling mechanism.
- **SAFe**:
- Scaling tools such as Agile Release Trains (ARTs) and Program Increment (PI) Planning, which coordinate work across many teams.

### **4.5 Focus Area**

- **Agile**:
- Delivers value to a customer or project quickly.
- **SAFe**:
- Ensures alignment of the organization's strategy and resources while maintaining agility.

### **5. What makes SAFe different?**

### **5.1 Structure and Scaling Framework**

- SAFe is built for large organizations with many teams working on complex projects. Its four levels ensure coherence and coordination.

### **5.2 Agile Release Trains (ARTs)**

- Introduces ARTs as a mechanism to coordinate 50-125 people working towards common goals.

### **5.3 Program Increment (PI) Planning**

- A central event where all teams plan and synchronize work for a period of 8-12 weeks.

### **5.4 Strategic Alignment**

- SAFe includes portfolio management, where strategic goals and resources are managed across the entire organization.

### **5.5 Roles and Responsibilities**

- Adds roles such as Release Train Engineer (RTE), Product Management, and Solution Architect to ensure governance and alignment across teams.

### **5.6 Built-in Lean and Systems Thinking**

- SAFe focuses on optimizing the entire system by applying lean principles and systems thinking.

### **6. Conclusion**

- **Similarities**: Both Agile and SAFe focus on flexibility, rapid delivery of value, and customer centricity.
- **Differences**:
- Agile is well-suited for small teams, while SAFe is designed to scale agile principles to large organizations.
- SAFe offers a structured framework with defined processes, roles, and levels to handle complex projects.
- **Unique Features of SAFe**:
- It combines agility with the necessary governance and structure required to scale successfully in large organizations. This makes SAFe ideal for organizations that want to balance flexibility with governance and strategic alignment.

**Recap of "Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)"**

### **Keynotes**

The presentation introduces SAFe, a framework designed to scale agile methodologies in large organizations with complex projects and many teams. It discusses the fundamental principles, process mechanisms, success factors, and challenges of adopting SAFe.

### **Main content**

1. **What is SAFe?**
- Introduced in 2011 by Dean Leffingwell.
- Integrates agile development methods, lean development, and systems thinking.
- Organizes teams and processes at four levels: Team, Program, Large Solution, and Portfolio.
- Focus areas:
- Team and technical agility.
- Customer-centric product delivery.
- Design thinking and continuous delivery.
2. **Process mechanism in SAFe**:
- Split backlog levels from portfolio to team, coordinated through Agile Release Trains (ARTs).
- Program Increment (PI) Planning ensures synchronization between teams over 8-12 week periods.
- Focus on built-in quality and delivery of products as needed.
3. **SAFe Success Factors**:
- **Organizational Support**: Leadership commitment and appropriate resources.
- **Training and Coaching**: Education in SAFe principles for all levels.
- **Communication and Involvement**: Creating a common understanding across teams and management.
- **Clear Processes**: Well-defined and understandable processes that promote trust and collaboration.
4. **SAFe Challenges**:
- **Complexity**: The structure can be difficult to understand and implement.
- **Resistance to Change**: Traditional cultures can create barriers to adoption.
- **Rigid Processes**: Some believe that SAFe can inhibit teamsâ€™ autonomy and flexibility.
5. **Effects of SAFe**:
- **Benefits**:
- Improved productivity and quality.
- Better coordination and visibility in the organization.
- Increased cohesion and efficiency.
- **Disadvantages**:
- High resource requirements.
- Limited flexibility and autonomy for teams.
- Risk of planning and hierarchical control that can be experienced as "non-agile".
6. **Research and Empirical Evidence**:
- Literature review and interviews with 25 SAFe practitioners from 17 companies.
- **Results**:
- Success requires leadership support, training and a clear vision.
- SAFe can be effective, but requires dedication and resources to achieve full impact.

### **Conclusion**

SAFe is a powerful framework for scaling agile methods in large organizations, but requires significant organizational support, training and investment. Although there are criticisms about complexity and rigidity, the results show that SAFe can create significant benefits in productivity, quality and cohesion if implemented correctly. The presentation recommends further research and continuous adaptation to maximize success.
