# Adopting SAFe to Scale Agile in a Globally Distributed Organization

**Recap of "Adopting SAFe to Scale Agile in a Globally Distributed Organization"**

### **Highlights**

This article describes a case study of how global software development company Comptel implemented the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) across two business lines. The article highlights differences between the adoptions, the challenges encountered, and the factors that contributed to success.

### **Main Content**

1. **Background and Purpose**:
- SAFe was selected as a solution to scale agile methodologies in an organization with global teams.
- Previously, the organization had a combination of Scrum in teams and a traditional waterfall model in product management, which created challenges such as delays, silo thinking, and lack of coordination.
2. **SAFe Adoption**:
- Both business lines implemented SAFe independently, starting in 2015.
- Program Increment (PI) Planning was a key change, with teams synchronizing plans over 10-week periods.
- Focus was on improving coordination, prioritization, and visibility across teams and products.
3. **Challenges and Solutions**:
- **Case 1**:
- No training prior to adoption, leading to resistance and chaotic PI planning events.
- Partially engaged change agents and lack of external coaching.
- **Case 2**:
- Preparations included SAFe training for all levels, reducing resistance.
- External coaches and a full-time Release Train Engineer (RTE) helped ensure successful implementation.
- Focus on continuous improvement and assigning responsibility for follow-up tasks.
4. **Case Comparison**:
- Case 2 learned from Case 1 and implemented better preparation, training, and continuous improvement.
- A full-time RTE and well-planned PI planning events contributed to better results in Case 2.
- In Case 1, employee satisfaction decreased, while 70% of team members in Case 2 were satisfied with SAFe.
5. **Success factors**:
- Early and comprehensive training in SAFe for all participants.
- Effective communication about the purpose of the change and the benefits of SAFe.
- Involvement of change agents and external coaches.
- Well-planned PI planning events to establish trust and commitment.
- Focus on continuous improvement with clear action plans.

### **Conclusion**

SAFe can be an effective method for scaling agile methods in large, global organizations, but success depends on careful planning, training, and communication. Case 2 shows how learning from previous experiences can lead to a more successful transformation. The article calls for further research into the implementation of scaling frameworks to offer more practical guidance to organizations.

 ## Abstract
 —Large software development organizations adopting
 agile methods need solutions and models to help scale agile to
 f
 it their needs. During recent years, several frameworks for
 scaling agile have been created by consultants, including the
 Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Large-scale Scrum (LeSS) and
 Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD). However, research on how
 these frameworks are adopted in practice is seriously lacking.
 In this paper we describe how Comptel, a globally distributed
 software development company, adopted the SAFe framework in
 two business lines. Based on eleven interviews we present why
 and how the organization adopted SAFe, and discuss related
 challenges and success factors. The comparison of the two
 adoptions showed that investing in SAFe trainings, engaging
 people and change agents, hiring a coach, investing in a full
time release train engineer, preparing well for the first planning
 event and continuously improving and customizing SAFe led to
 good results.
 
 ## DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
 We compared the adoption of the SAFe framework in two
 business lines of the same globally distributed case organi
zation. The business line adopting SAFe later was, based
 on the interviews, clearly more successful in its’ transfor
mation, which can be partially explained by learning from
 the experiences of the first case. General change management
 related factors seemed to explain most of the differences
 in success between the cases. We identified the following
 success factors: 1) training the personnel well in advance, 2)
  informing and engaging people, 3) involving change agents, 4)
 hiring an experienced external consultant to train, advice and
 support, 5) preparing well for the first PI planning event, 6)
 having a full-time RTE and 7) taking recognized improvement
 items seriously by assigning responsibilities and monitoring
 their implementation. Comparing these findings to the success
 factors of large-scale agile transformations in general , the
 four first mentioned items are high on the literature review list.
 Thus, these seem to be success factors for all kinds of large
scale agile transformations, not only for SAFe transformations.
 As the case organization was globally distributed, the main
 SAFe events, the 2-day PI planning events were organized
 using an electronic communication solution between the main
 sites and timing the events to enable synchronous participation
 from all sites. The leader of the PI planning, RTE, was located
 in one case in Malaysia and in another case in Finland.
 Even though distributed events are often challenging, our
 interviewees found these events quite successful and did not
 mention global distribution as a problem, but instead felt that
 communication channels worked well. We were positively
 surprised of this finding.
 Due to budgetary restrictions we were able to visit only
 the main development site in Finland, as well as perform two
 video interviews with persons from the other big development
 site in Malaysia, which is a limitation of this initial study.
 In the future, we aim to continue the study by interviewing
 a few more persons from the distributed sites to be able to
 better confirm our findings related to distributed sites.
 We encourage other researchers to conduct case studies on
 the usage of SAFe and other scaling frameworks. That way
 we can provide practitioners objective pieces of advice on
 what kind of scaling frameworks and practices suit to different
 situations and what are the challenges and successful practices
 when scaling agile to large and distributed organizations.
