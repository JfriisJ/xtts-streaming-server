### **Main Contents**

1. **Background**:
- LeSS is a scaled version of Scrum, designed to coordinate many teams in large organizations.
- The organization had previously experienced challenges with dependencies, information gaps, and inefficient coordination processes.
2. **Research Questions**:
- How was LeSS adopted in different products?
- How was LeSS applied in practice in different products?
3. **Adoption of LeSS**:
- **Duration**: Adopted within 3-12 months depending on product complexity.
- **Purpose**: Improved team coordination, reduced dependencies, and a shift from project to product focus.
- **Combinations**: LeSS was often combined with Kanban and DevOps for better task and process management.
- **Training**: Extensive training programs and workshops were used to ensure understanding of LeSS principles.
4. **Usage of LeSS**:
- **Roles**: Standard roles such as Product Owner (PO), Scrum Master (SM), and Feature Teams (FT) were supplemented with new roles, such as domain-specific POs.
- **Artifacts**: The use of backlog, definition of done (DoD), and definition of ready (DoR) varied between products.
- **Processes**: Key LeSS events, such as sprint reviews and retrospectives, were widely implemented, but with varying levels of effectiveness.
5. **Challenges**:
- **Coordination issues**: Many meetings reduced productivity.
- **Dual leadership**: Split PO roles between business and IT created inefficiency.
- **Cultural differences**: Differences between international teams created barriers to collaboration.
- **Lack of agile mindset**: The transition from traditional methods to LeSS was challenging.
6. **Success factors**:
- **Transparency**: High transparency increased trust between teams.
- **Training and workshops**: Shared understanding and practical exercises facilitated adoption.
- **Involvement**: Early involvement of employees reduced resistance to change.
7. **Lessons Learned**:
- Practical exercises in small projects improved understanding of LeSS.
- Centrally coordinated sprint cadences created structure, but could conflict with self-organization.

### **Conclusion**

LeSS is an effective tool for scaling agile methods in large organizations, but requires adaptation to existing structures. Challenges such as dual leadership and cultural differences must be addressed for success. The article recommends more case studies and cross-sectional analyses to further explore the use of LeSS in different types of organizations.
