# **Differences between LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum) and SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)**

LeSS and SAFe are both scaling frameworks for agile methodologies, designed to handle complex projects in large organizations. They share the common goal of optimizing collaboration between many teams and delivering high quality quickly, but they differ significantly in their approach, structure, and philosophy.

---

### **1. Philosophy and Focus**

### **LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)**:

- **Philosophy**: "More with less". Focus on simplicity and avoiding unnecessary roles, processes, and artifacts.
- **Focus**:
- Preserve Scrum's core principles (transparency, inspection, and adaptation) at scale.
- Minimize organizational complexity.
- Empower teams and decentralize decision-making.

### **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)**:

- **Philosophy**: A holistic framework that combines agile, lean and systems thinking to optimize the entire organization.
- **Focus**:
- Structure and governance across multiple levels of the organization.
- Centralized control with strategic alignment and portfolio management.
- Built-in mechanisms for planning and coordination (e.g. Agile Release Trains).

---

### **2. Structure and Scaling**

### **LeSS**:

- **Simple Structure**:
- Two variants:
- **LeSS**: For 2-8 teams working on one product.
- **LeSS Huge**: For 8+ teams, where multiple requirement areas are managed by Area Product Owners.
- Shared sprint, shared backlog and one Product Owner.
- Coordination through simple techniques such as "just talk" and Scrum of Scrums.
- **Decentralization**:
- Teams gain greater responsibility for processes and results.

### **SAFe**:

- **Complex Structure**:
- Four levels: **Team, Program, Large Solution and Portfolio**.
- Agile Release Trains (ARTs) coordinate 50-125 people.
- Roles such as Release Train Engineer (RTE) and Solution Architect support governance.
- **Centralization**:
- Strong focus on hierarchical structure and centralized planning.

---

### **3. Roles and Responsibilities**

### **LeSS**:

- Few roles:
- **Product Owner (PO)**: One PO manages one common backlog, even across many teams.
- **Scrum Master (SM)**: One SM can support multiple teams.
- Avoids unnecessary roles to keep the organization simple.

### **SAFe**:

- Many roles:
- **Product Owner (PO)**: One PO works in individual teams and is team specific.
- Additional roles such as Release Train Engineer (RTE), Product Management and System Architect.
- These roles ensure governance and management in complex organizations.

---

### **4. Planning and Coordination**

### **LeSS**:

- **Sprint Planning**:
- Common Sprint Planning 1 for all teams (which backlog items should be prioritized?).
- Team-specific Sprint Planning 2 to define how the tasks will be solved.
- **Coordination**:
- Coordinated directly between teams without many intermediate layers.

### **SAFe**:

- **Program Increment (PI) Planning**:
- A central event for all teams in Agile Release Trains to synchronize work for the next 8-12 weeks.
- **Coordination**:
- ARTs and multiple hierarchical levels ensure coordination.

---

### **5. Focus on Organization vs. Teams**

### **LeSS**:

- **Teams in Focus**:
- Empower teams to self-organize and make decisions.
- Minimize hierarchical control and intermediaries.
- The entire organization is organized around product development.

### **SAFe**:

- **Organization in Focus**:
- Alignment across teams, programs, and portfolios.
- Strengthens governance, strategic planning, and budgeting.
- More suitable for organizations with complex hierarchies.

---

### **6. Adaptation and Experimentation**

### **LeSS**:

- Promotes experimentation and learning:
- Encourages teams to continuously adapt processes.
- Greater freedom for teams to choose their working methods.

### **SAFe**:

- More standardized:
- Predefined processes and guidelines to ensure consistency.
- Less flexibility for teams in adapting processes.

---

### **7. Typical Use Cases**

### **LeSS**:

- Organizations with a strong agile culture and low organizational complexity.
- Projects that require close collaboration between many teams on one product.

### **SAFe**:

- Large organizations with complex hierarchies and many stakeholders.
- Projects requiring strategic alignment and governance across multiple levels.

### **Summary**

| **Aspect** | **LeSS** | **SAFe** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Philosophy** | Simplicity, decentralization, teams in focus | Structure, governance, organization in focus |
| **Structure** | Few levels (2-8 teams per product) | Multiple levels (Team, Program, Portfolio) |
| **Roles** | Few roles, one PO for all teams | Many roles, centralized control |
| **Planning** | Shared sprint planning | Program Increment (PI) Planning |
| **Complexity** | Simple and easy to understand | Complex with many processes and rules |
| **Focus area** | Teams and product development | Organization and strategic alignment |

---

### **What makes them unique?**

- **LeSS**: Simplicity and team autonomy make it ideal for organizations that want to scale Scrum without adding unnecessary complexity.
- **SAFe**: Structured and hierarchical, perfect for large organizations that require governance and strategic alignment.
