### **Main Content**

1. **Background and Purpose**:
- SAFe was selected as a solution to scale agile methodologies in an organization with global teams.
- Previously, the organization had a combination of Scrum in teams and a traditional waterfall model in product management, which created challenges such as delays, silo thinking, and lack of coordination.
2. **SAFe Adoption**:
- Both business lines implemented SAFe independently, starting in 2015.
- Program Increment (PI) Planning was a key change, with teams synchronizing plans over 10-week periods.
- Focus was on improving coordination, prioritization, and visibility across teams and products.
3. **Challenges and Solutions**:
- **Case 1**:
- No training prior to adoption, leading to resistance and chaotic PI planning events.
- Partially engaged change agents and lack of external coaching.
- **Case 2**:
- Preparations included SAFe training for all levels, reducing resistance.
- External coaches and a full-time Release Train Engineer (RTE) helped ensure successful implementation.
- Focus on continuous improvement and assigning responsibility for follow-up tasks.
4. **Case Comparison**:
- Case 2 learned from Case 1 and implemented better preparation, training, and continuous improvement.
- A full-time RTE and well-planned PI planning events contributed to better results in Case 2.
- In Case 1, employee satisfaction decreased, while 70% of team members in Case 2 were satisfied with SAFe.
5. **Success factors**:
- Early and comprehensive training in SAFe for all participants.
- Effective communication about the purpose of the change and the benefits of SAFe.
- Involvement of change agents and external coaches.
- Well-planned PI planning events to establish trust and commitment.
- Focus on continuous improvement with clear action plans.

### **Conclusion**

SAFe can be an effective method for scaling agile methods in large, global organizations, but success depends on careful planning, training, and communication. Case 2 shows how learning from previous experiences can lead to a more successful transformation. The article calls for further research into the implementation of scaling frameworks to offer more practical guidance to organizations.
